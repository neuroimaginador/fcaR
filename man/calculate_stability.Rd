\title{Calculate Concept Stability}
\usage{
calculate_stability(extents)

calculate_stability(extents)
}
\arguments{
\item{extents}{A \code{SparseSet} object or a sparse matrix (\code{CsparseMatrix}) representing concept extents (columns are concepts).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector.

A numeric vector with stability values in \eqn{[0, 1]}.
}
\description{
Calculates the intensional stability of each concept.

Calculates the intensional stability of each concept in the lattice directly from the sparse matrix representation.
Stability measures the probability that a concept is preserved when a random subset of objects is removed.
